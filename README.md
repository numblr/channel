channel
=======

Signal processing channels based on generator functions.


This repository provides generator functions that create an initalized generator for
input procssing. Processing is done by sending the input to the generator
using its send method.

Implementations for several input formats, like strings, numbers or arrays are provided.

In addition the possibility to connect channels to a network, which in turn is a channel itself, is provided.
