channel
=======

Signal processing channels based on generators.


This repository provides generator functions that create an initalized generator for input processing. Processing is done by sending the input to the generator using its send method.

Implementations for several input formats, like strings, numbers and arrays are provided.

In addition, the possibility to connect channels to a network, which in turn is a channel itself, is provided.
